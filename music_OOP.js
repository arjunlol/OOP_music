// Work incrementally but by the end of it you should have defined multiple prototype functions:

// Library
// Playlist
// Track
// This one will be slightly different from the Week 1 in that it will have the following functionality:

// A Library has a name and a creator (both strings) done
// These are the only things required in order to create a music library
// A Library has many playlists (starts as an empty array) done
// Playlist objects can be added to an instance of a library
// Each Playlist has a name which is required upon creation
// A Playlist also has many tracks
// A Track has a title, a rating (an integer from 1 to 5) and a length (integer in seconds) all of which are required when creating a new track
// Each Playlist also has an overallRating function which will calculate the rating by averaging the rating of its tracks
// Each Playlist also has a totalDuration function which will sum the duration of all of its tracks
// Once defined, your code should use new to instantiate these functions to create instances of one library and then add new tracks and playlists to the library.

class Playlist {
  constructor(name) {
    this.
  }
// Each Playlist also has an overallRating function which will calculate the rating by averaging the rating of its tracks
// Each Playlist also has a totalDuration function which will sum the duration of all of its tracks


}

class Track {
  constructor(title, rating, length) {
// A Track has a title, a rating (an integer from 1 to 5) and a length (integer in seconds) all of which are required when creating a new track

  }
}

class Library {
  constructor(name, creator) {
    this.
    this._playlists = [];

  }
//add playlist to add playlist object to library
}
